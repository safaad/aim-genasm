# AIM: Alignment-in-Memory A Framework for High-throughput Sequence Alignment using Real Processing-in-Memory Systems
AIM is a framework for high-throughput pairwise sequence alignment
using processing-in-memory. It targets [UPMEM](https://www.upmem.com/), the first publicly-available
general-purpose programmable PIM architecture. AIM dispatches a large number
of sequence pairs across different memory modules and aligns each pair
using compute cores within the memory module where it resides. It supports multiple alignment algorithms including NW, SWG, GenASM [[1](#myfootnote1)], WFA [[2](#myfootnote2)], and WFA-
adaptive, and includes two implementations of each algorithm that
manage the UPMEM memory hierarchy differently and are suitable
for different read lengths.

We evaluate AIM on a real UPMEM system and compare the throughput it can achieve with that achieved by server-grade multi-threaded CPU systems running at full scale.
Our evaluation shows that a real PIM system can substantially outperform CPU systems for a wide variety of algorithms, read lengths, and edit distance thresholds. For example, for WFA-adaptive, the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm, AIM achieves a speedup of up to 2.56x when data transfer time is included, and up to 28.14x when data transfer time is not included.

## Repository Structure
Each folder of this repository has the PIM implementations relative to the GenASM alignment algorithm. For each alignment algorithm, we provide two PIM implementations: (1) DPU-WRAM implementation stores the alignment data in the WRAM, and (2) DPU-MRAM implementation stores the alignment data in the MRAM and uses the WRAM as cache memory.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
AIM is designed to run on a server with a real UPMEM-PIM modules. However, the functional simulator included in the [UPMEM SDK](https://sdk.upmem.com/) can be also used to run the implementations. The used SDK version in AIM is [2021.3.0](https://sdk.upmem.com/).

### Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/safaad/aim-genasm
cd aim-genasm
```
### Running AIM
AIM provides a python script to run each PIM implementation `run_*_pim.py`. The script estimates the upper limit of the used WRAM and MRAM memory in order to determine the number of DPU threads needed `NR_TASKLETS`.It takes as an input features of the read pairs dataset such as read length, edit distance threshold, and the number of sequence pairs to align. Below is an example of running GenASM-Filter MRAM implementation (same method can be used for all versions) while enabling backtracing on a dataset with sequence length 100bp, ED=1%, and 40K sequence pairs:
```bash
cd GenASM/DPU-MRAM-filter

# Script usage
> python run-genasmfilter-pim-mram.py
> usage: run-genasmfilter-pim-mram.py [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] -l READ_LENGTH [-e ERROR] -n NUMBER_READS [-m MATCH_COST]
                                    [-x MISMATCH_COST] [-g GAP_OPENING] [-a GAP_EXTENDING] [-k MAX_EDIT] [-t NR_OF_TASKLETS]
                                    [-d NR_OF_DPUS]
                           
# Example of running GenASM-filter MRAM implementation
python run-genasmfilter-pim-mram.py -i ../../Datasets/sample-l100-e1-40K.01 -l 100 -e 0.01 -n 40000 -d 2500

```
Note that this script uses heuristics to estimate the upper limit of the used WRAM and MRAM memory, so it might underestimate the `NR_TASKLETS` to avoid running out of memory.


Or, the user can compile and run these implementations manually but needs to determine the `NR_TASKLETS` and the `WRAM_SEGMENT` size assigned to each thread. Also, the sequence length, max edit distance, and the number of sequence pairs should be added at the compile and run time. For example:
```bash
cd GenASM/DPU-MRAM-filter

# Compile example
make NR_TASKLETS=19 NR_DPUS=2500 FLAGS="-DMAX_SCORE=1 -DREAD_SIZE=112 -DWRAM_SEGMENT=2122"

# Run Example
./build/host ../../Datasets/sample-l100-e1-40K.01 ./out 40000
```
Each line of the output file will contain the number of the aligned read-reference pair, the edit distance in case, and the CIGAR string if the backtracing is enabled.
